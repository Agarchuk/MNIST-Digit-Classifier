# ðŸ”¢ MNIST Digit Classifier: From Pixels to Predictions

A beginner-friendly project to learn image classification using the MNIST dataset. This project takes you from loading the dataset to building your own neural network and deploying a simple digit recognition app!

---

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

**What it does:**  
Predicts handwritten digits (0â€“9) from images using a neural network trained on the MNIST dataset.

**Why it matters:**  
This simulates core principles used in OCR systems, bank check processing, digit entry forms, and basic handwriting recognition.

**Final Deliverable:**  
A functioning digit classifier app that allows the user to draw a digit or upload one, and displays the predicted number with confidence scores.
