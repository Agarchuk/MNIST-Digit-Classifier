## üß† Model Architecture

The project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the following features:
- Multiple layer configurations (1/2/3 layers)
- Convolutional layers with LeakyReLU activation
- Max pooling layers
- Fully connected layers
- Dropout for regularization

## üìä Data Preprocessing

The MNIST dataset is preprocessed as follows:
- Images are normalized to [0, 1] range
- Resized to 28x28 pixels
- Converted to grayscale (1 channel)
- Image format conversion and validation

## üß™ How to Run

1. Clone the repo  
2. Create and activate virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
